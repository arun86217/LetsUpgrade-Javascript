    <ul>
        <li><code>var</code> declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block scoped.</li>
        <li><code>var</code> variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; <code>let</code> variables can be updated but not re-declared; <code>const</code> variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</li>
        <li>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while <code>var</code> variables are initialized with <code>undefined</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> variables are not initialized.</li><li>While <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> can be declared without being initialized, <code>const</code> must be initialized during declaration.</li>
    </ul>

        An example of trying to redeclare a let variable:
            // In editor:
            <!-- <script
            let points = 50;
            let points = 60;
            /script>
            // In the console I get an error:
            Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'points' has already been declared

            how can i update it
            let points = 50;
            points = 60;
            // In console:
            points
            // Returns:
            60

            let and var can be reassigned to a new value while const cannot be reassigned.
            var a = 10;
            a = 20;
            //output: 20
            console.log(a);

            let b = 'hello';
            b = 'world';
            //output: 'world'   
            console.log(b);

            const c = 'hello'
            //Error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
            c = 'world' -->
